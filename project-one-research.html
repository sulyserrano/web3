	I have recently been into Boba so much. I've been trying out new locations and this one is really great. There service is wonderful and the drinks are amazing. There a alot of other boba shops and many of them are small businesses with excellent customer service and obviously amzing BOBA. One of the competitions is like a franchise, it has many locations throughout the LA and Ventura county. I really feel there website is an excellent choice to redesign. Moving forward with the redesign, the site needs more life. At the moment it is a grey color page informing where to "order" which then redirects us to a different site. The logo that is used at the location isn't even presented on the site. That should be included.They have implemented the menu following the order button. There chosen colors seem to be a teal, black, and white. As a redesign I suggest adding a immage or gallery sliding. It would allow the viewer first hand to experience how the drinks look like. Might even start to make there mouth water. It would help customers have a better expereince visualizing the kind of art they create with the drinks. </p>
